## Abstract

This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the trend and seasonal components present in monthly gold prices in India over the period from January 2022 to December 2024. To identify underlying patterns and forecast future prices, various time series models have been applied, including linear, quadratic, exponential, modified exponential, and Gompertz growth models. The results reveal a consistently increasing trend in gold prices throughout the study period, along with mild but observable seasonal fluctuations, indicating that gold prices in India are influenced not only by long-term market dynamics but also by short-term periodic factors. These insights may assist investors, policymakers, and market analysts in making informed decisions regarding gold investment strategies and economic forecasting.

## Introduction

Gold has long held a vital role in Indiaâ€™s economy, serving both as a symbol of wealth and a reliable investment asset for households and institutions alike. Recognizing its economic importance, this study applies a range of time series models to monthly gold price data from January 2022 to December 2024. The objective is to examine underlying trends and seasonal variations, and to generate reliable forecasts for gold prices up to December 2025.

## Literature Review
Previous studies, such as those by Ghosh & Ghosh and Kale & Patil, have extensively explored gold price behavior in the Indian market using techniques like ARIMA, exponential smoothing models, and classical decomposition. Building upon their work, the present study draws inspiration from these approaches and extends the analysis by employing the R programming environment. In particular, it incorporates multiple trend-fitting techniques, including nonlinear models such as the Gompertz function, to enhance forecasting accuracy and capture complex growth patterns in gold prices.

## Data Description
*The data was sourced from Investing.com, specifically selecting monthly gold prices in INR for a three-year period. The dataset includes the date and closing price of gold futures.*

```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset
df <- read.csv("gold_prices_2022_2024.csv")

# Convert 'Dates' column to Date format (DD-MM-YYYY)
df$Date <- as.Date(df$Dates, format = "%d-%m-%Y")

# Rename Prices column
df$Price <- df$Prices

# Keep only needed columns
df <- df[, c("Date", "Price")]

# Preview the first few rows
head(df)

df$Time <- 1:nrow(df)   # Adds 'Time' to your data
Time <- df$Time         # Optional: creates global 'Time' variable

```

## Trend Analysis
*Trend represents the general direction in which a time series moves over a long period. Various methods can be used to identify and model trends:*

### Graphical Method  
*This method involves plotting the time series data and visually identifying the trend.*

```{r trend-graphical}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Price)) +
  geom_line(color = 'blue') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = min(Date), xend = max(Date),
                   y = Price[1], yend = Price[nrow(df)]),
               color = 'red', linetype = 'dashed') +
  labs(title = 'Gold Prices Over Time (India)', 
       x = 'Date', y = 'Gold Price (INR)') +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Semi Average Method
*This method divides the data into two equal parts and computes the averages to estimate the trend.*

second_half_avg <- mean(df$Price[(half+1):n])

# Find middle points of each half
first_half_date <- df$Date[half %/% 2]
second_half_date <- df$Date[half + (n - half) %/% 2]

# Plot actual prices
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Price)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +  # Actual price trend
  geom_point(aes(x = first_half_date, y = first_half_avg), color = "red", size = 3) +  # First half avg

## Conclusion
Gold prices in India have demonstrated a steady upward trend from 2022 to 2024, a pattern that reflects the commodity's role as both a safe-haven asset and a culturally significant investment. Through the application of various time series models â€” including linear, quadratic, exponential, modified exponential, and the nonlinear Gompertz curve â€” this study explored the underlying structure of price movements and their future trajectories.

Among the methods employed, the quadratic trend model and Gompertz curve offered the most accurate fit to historical data, capturing both the gradual acceleration in price growth and the tendency toward saturation. 

Seasonal analysis, using both Ratio-to-Trend and Ratio-to-Moving-Average methods, revealed mild but notable seasonal effects, particularly aligned with months associated with festivals and peak wedding seasons in India. Although seasonality does not dominate the trend, its recognition is essential for short-term decision-making and timing investments.

This research serves as a foundation for gold price modeling using classical time series techniques and emphasizes the value of interpretability, especially when dealing with relatively limited but reliable datasets. While the current analysis is based solely on historical prices, future work could integrate external economic variables such as inflation, interest rates, or global market indices. Additionally, incorporating ARIMA models, hybrid statistical-learning techniques, or machine learning approaches (like LSTM or Prophet) could further improve forecast precision and adaptability.

Overall, this study offers valuable insights for investors, financial analysts, and researchers seeking to understand and anticipate gold price movements in the Indian market.
